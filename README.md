This is a currently unsupported application that I built with github.com/noahhines over the summer of 2015.

We will (hopefully) (eventually) finish this and integrate it with the fitbit.

The application uses the Facebook API for logging in and is a step counter - where the basic idea is to "out step" or stay ahead of an animal - as a means to encourage people to be less sedentary in their daily lives.
